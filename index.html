        <h2>[Jonathan Bennett]</h2>
        <p>[I am a Computer Science major who is pursuing a minor in Psychology. Reading is a favourite pastime of mine and I enjoy playing billiards as well. 
            My interest in web development begun many years ago when I picked up graphic design as a hobby and learnt about web dev as well. Additionally, 
            I am responsible for fixing the website at the company I work part time with currently, so this course serves as a good learning opportunity.
